        <p> Kronk, the  beloved character from 'The Emperor's New Groove and his own spin off film, 'Kronk's New Groove' was shown
        to be a fantastic chef, with one of his signature dishes being the spinach puff! Taking inspiration from this, we have devised
      our own recipe for the tasty treat! </p>

        <h2> Ingredients (Serves 4-6)</h2>
        <div class= "ingredients"
        <p> Approximately 300g of thawed spinach
          <br> 1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese <br> 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion
          <br> 1 tablespoon olive oil <br> 1 teaspoon chopped dill (or an alternative herb such as basil)
          <br> 1 teaspoon minced garlic (or garlic powder) <br> Salt and black pepper
          <br> 2 large eggs <br> 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed and rolled out to a 12-inch square
           and kept chilled </p>
        </div>

        <h3> Method </h3>
        <div class= "method"
        <ol type="1">
          <li> Squeeze out spinach until dry, mixing with the next 5 Ingredients </li>
          <li> Season with salt and pepper</li>
          <li> Beat 1 egg to blend and fold into the spinach mixture </li>
          <li> Cut the pastry into 3 equal strips, keeping one strip for another use </li>
          <li> Cut each strip into 3 again, totalling 6. Place a square in each cup of the muffin pan, pressing the bottom and sides down,
            leaving the corners pointing up </li>
          <li> Divide the filling between cups and fold the pastry corners over the filling, pressing the corners
          to meet in the centre, cover the puffs and chill </li>
          <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, beating the remaining egg to blend in a small bowl </li>
          <li> Brush pastry with the egg, giving it a nice sheen and bake for around 25 minutes, or until
            the pastry is golden brown and puffy </li>
          <li> Transfer to a wired rack and let the puffs cool for around 10 minutes in the pan </li>
          <li> Run a sharp knife around the pan edges to loosen and turn the puffs out onto the rack to cool before serving </li>
        </ol>
